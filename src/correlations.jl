Correlation function for detonation cell width proposed by Gavrikov et al
COMBUSTION AND FLAME 120:19ÔøΩ33 (2000) based on using a reaction zone length based on time
to limiting reactant consumption in constant volume explosion approximation using vn
postshock velocity to convert time to distance.
Tested against a range of fuel-oxidizer diluent mixtures

INPUT:
    Œ¥ = reaction zone length based on time to 50consumption of limiting
    reactant from CV computation and delta = time * w_VN
    Œ∏ = E‚Çê/RT_VN,  effective reduced activation energy based on CV
    computation
    Tvn = von Neumann (postshock temperature behind CJ shock wave)
    T‚ÇÄ = initial temperature
