    Computes the equilibrium sound speed by using a centered finite
    difference approximation. Directly evaluating pressure at two density/specific
    volume states along an isentrope requires use of equilibrate('SV'). However,
    this may not always converge at high pressure. Instead, a more robust method
    using equilibrate('TP') is used that employs thermodynamic identities detailed
    further in Appendix G2 of the report.
    
    The old version of this code that used 'SV' instead of 'TP' is commented out
